            methodology, mentor matching and leadership modules, our elite
            engineers are equipped with techniques and a

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          As part of our curriculum, we expose our engineers to real-life
          applications and projects. During these projects, we ensure they are
          well-equipped to design programs both individually and in teams. This
          aspect of our program provides our engineers with verifiable work
          experience and the confidence to excel in their jobs after graduation.
        </p>

        <h2>Internships</h2>
        <p>
          We offer a select number of organizations a free non-committal 2
          months internship with our outstanding developers prior to graduation.
        </p>

        <h2>Placement</h2>
        <p>
          At the end of the program, most Decagon developers are matched with
          our hiring partners to join their engineering teams full-time, either
          remotely or in person.
