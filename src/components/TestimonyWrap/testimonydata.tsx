My experience at Decagon has been really challenging and the same time refreshing because I get to learn new problem-solving concepts and techniques everyday. It's a six months of dedication and sacrifice which will definitely be rewarding, you can do it.",

      "I was into teaching before Decagon so basically I joined Decagon as a beginner. It hasn't been easy though, so many concepts to learn within a short period of time. My typical day is eat and code lol! . The good side is that I have lots of people helping me out within the facility, mentoring and motivating me to be the best I can. Asides from programming skills in Python and its framework Django, Postgresql, Celery and Redis, my communication skill has greatly improved, I understand better what it means to work as a team and within an Agile framework. Decagon Institute is the place to be, they don't only cater for your programming needs, they also hone your soft-skills , providing you with a huge network of people with like minds(Developers) .",

      "I've always had a keen interest in coding but never dedicated enough time to practise. So after completing my NYSC in October 2019 with nothing much going on ,I took the opportunity to start coding seriously. My time at Decagon has been fantastic. The content is excellent, the staff and students are friendly, and the course is structured in such a way that you get a good idea of what it is really like to work in a dev job. The general principles of programming are covered, so you won't have to fear learning other programming languages to increase your skills.",

      "I was unemployed before coming to Decagon so I considered the program a great opportunity to start my career. Presently, I have been exposed to different concepts and ways of looking at problems. I have learnt how to collaborate with different people to produce a product. I have learnt about the technicalities involved in producing apps. Decagon was not joking when they said the program will be intense. You will feel like you don't know anything at times, or you just want to give up but just persevere and things will be alright at the end.",

      "Before Decagon, I tried my hand at various means to earn money from freelancing as I was coding on the side. My experience at Decagon has been truly amazing. I learned so much in such a little time. My team, Stack members, and my roomies have been a huge addition to my life. I can't even begin to express the joy I feel knowing iâ€™m a step closer to where I want to be. I have also improved my ability to work in a team, build team spirit, Self-development, Time management, Problem solving. My advice to aspiring decadevs would be, If you believe it, work towards it, you will achieve it.",
