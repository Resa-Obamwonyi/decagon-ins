My experience at Decagon has been really challenging and the same time refreshing because I get to learn new problem-solving concepts and techniques everyday. It's a six months of dedication and sacrifice which will definitely be rewarding, you can do it."

I Have learnt iOS technical skills, agile skills and communication skills. To anyone interested in joining the program, be determined, make sure software development is really what you want to do. Be willing to try out new things even if they seem difficult."
